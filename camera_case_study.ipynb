    "Traffic cameras have become an important data source for transportation management and control. However, deriving reliable traffic metrics from the camera feeds is challenging due to the limitations of current vehicle detection techniques, as well as the various camera conditions such as height and resolution. The figure below shows two examples of using a state-of-the-art deep learning detector to identify the vehicles in traffic images. It is clear that vehicles distant from the camera are often too small to be detected. Missed small vehicles tend to result in significant errors in the estimation of road traffic metrics. \n",

    "In this jupyter notebook, we illustrate a quadtree-based algorithm that continuously partitions the image extent until only regions with high detection accuracy are remained. These regions are referred to as the high-accuracy identification regions (HAIR), which will be used to derive reliable road traffic metrics such as traffic density, flow, and speed. A case study in Central Ohio is presented to demonstrate how the use of HAIR can help to improve the accuracy of traffic density estimates using images from a camera. "
